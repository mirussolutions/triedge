Description:
    Stubs out a scaffolded controller, its seven RESTful actions and related
    views. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or under_scored. The
    controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model name
    namespaces within Admin namespaced.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers/admin and invokes helper,
    template engine and test framework generators.
    It uses non-namespaced model in app/models

    If you want change the prefix name 'admin' to something else you can pass --prefix_name option

Example:
    `bin/rails generate admin:scaffold_controller Post`
    `bin/rails g admin:scaffold_controller Post title:string content:text published:boolean --prefix_name=manager`
